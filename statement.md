📌 Problem Statement

Managing inventory manually in small stationery shops often leads to confusion, stock mismatches, missing items, and pricing errors. Traditional paper-based tracking or unorganized methods make it difficult to keep records updated, especially when the variety of items is large. There is a need for a simple and efficient system that can maintain item details such as stock levels, prices, and availability in real-time.

The Stationary Store Inventory Management System aims to solve this by providing a structured, menu-driven Python application that helps store owners manage inventory with accuracy and ease.
